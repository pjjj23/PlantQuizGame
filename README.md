### ABOUT 
Hello everyone! I'm PJ, and I'm excited to share my project, a fun, interactive Quiz Game!

The game includes different question types like multiple choice, fill-in-the-blanks, image guessing, and true or false. Itâ€™s built using PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, running smoothly on localhost.

For a better user experience, it has a splash screen, logins for both players and admins, responsive design, and even audio.

The game mechanics let players choose topics like Plant Identification, Plant Care, Plant Uses, Plant Trivia, and Environmental Impact. After picking a topic, players select a difficulty level (easy, medium, or hard). Each game costs one heart, and if hearts reach zero, players can use a lifeline to restore one and keep playing.

Players can compete on the leaderboard for high scores, while admins can easily manage questions and handle user accounts.
 
This project is a Plant Quiz Game with questions and answers, the questions are made by the admin and the students are the players.
The user will be able to choose between four categories and three difficulty levels.
Each difficulty has a time to it, beat your highscore and aim for the 1st placer in achievements!
This game has a sound, is responsive, has a lifeline.
